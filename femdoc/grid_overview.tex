Before you can start using the model you have to create a numerical grid.
Ths step is more difficult for models that work on unstructured grids
(like finite element models) than for finite difference models, where
often it is enough to have a regular gridded bathymetry to start running
simulations.

This chapter describes the steps that you have to take in order to be able
to create a numerical grid for SHYFEM. If you are in the happy position
to already have a numerical finite element grid, then you can jump ahead
to the section on how to transform to/from other grid formats. You might
still have to interpolate a bathymetry onto the numerical grid, so you
will have to refer to the section on interpolating bathymetry. In any
case, at the end you will have to create a (unformatted) basin file,
so that SHYFEM is able to read in the information.

The steps that have to be carried out to create a numerical grid are

\begin{enumerate}

\item obtain raw digital data of the coastline and the bathymetry

\item convert the digital data into a format GRD that is read by the
	provided routines

\item prepare the coastline

\item create the numerical grid with an automatic grid generator

\item regularize the grid

\item interpolate bathymetry onto the created grid

\item create the basin file (the finite element version of the grid file)

\end{enumerate}

As mentioned above, some of the steps can be skipped if you already
have a finite element grid. If you already have a grid with bathymetry
information you can jump to point 7. However, you will have to convert
your grid into the |GRD| format used by SHYFEM. The |GRD| format is
documented in the appendix. For some of the most common unstructured grid
formats routines are available to convert between these formats and the
|GRD| format. In any case, the |GRD| format is quite easy to parse and
write, so you might be able to write a transformation routine yourself.

In the following a description is given what you have to do if you start
from scratch. Please refer to the section on other programs to create
a grid for conversion routines.
