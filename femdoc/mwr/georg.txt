Before discretizing we first multiply the continuity
equation by the form function $\phi_N$ and integrate
over one element to obtain
\[
\int \Phi_N \tdif{\zeta} + \int \Phi_N \xdif{U} + \int \Phi_N \ydif{V} = 0.
\]
The terms containing the spatial differentiation can now be transformed
by partial integration in the following way
\[ \label[eq:conti1]
        \int \Phi_N \xdif{U} + \int \Phi_N \ydif{V} =
        - \int \xdif[Phi_N] U - \int \ydif[Phi_N] V +
                \int_[\partial\Omega] \Phi_N U_n ds =
        - \int b_N U - \int c_N V +
                \int_[\partial\Omega] \Phi_N U_n ds.
\]
Here the last integral is a line integral over the border of
the element and $U_n$ the transport normal to the border. Once the
various contributions of the elements are summed the terms of the last
integral are equal in modulus but of inverse sign and therefore
cancel out. The only terms that do not cancel out are the
line integral over the border of the domain.

In case of a material boundary the trasnport noram lto the boundary
vanishes, and therefore the line integral over these elements
is again zero. The only contribution different from zero is therefore
at the open boundaries. In this case the line integral is exactly
the discharge over the open boundary out of the domain. It is
therefore natural to specify a flux boundary condition with finite elements.
However, in case the water levels are specified this boundary
condition is not needed and is substituted with a level
boundary condition. We will not further consider this
term from now on.


The integrated continuity equation is now discretized in time
in the following way
\[
        \int \frac[\zetan-\zetao][\dt] \dO =
                b_N \int ( \az \Un + \azt \Uo ) \dO +  
                c_N \int ( \az \Vn + \azt \Vo ) \dO
\]
