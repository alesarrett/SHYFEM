%\begin{abstract}
%The main features of a newly conceived primitive equation circulation
%model are outlined. The model uses finite elements for spatial
%integration and a semi-implicit algorithm for integration in time.
%The terms treated implicitly are the water levels, the Coriolis term
%and the vertical eddy diffusion. The model uses a combination of
%linear form functions for the expansion of the
%water levels and constant form functions for the velocities.
%Through this combination of form functions the resulting grid resembles
%a staggered finite difference Arakawa B-grid. This
%staggered finite element grid is superior, as far as conservation
%and propagation properties are concerned, to a standard Galerkin method.
%The model has already been used successfully with
%the Venice Lagoon and
%in its full three dimensional formulation will be also
%applied to the Adriatic Sea.

\section*{The Equations}


We start with the momentum equations and the continuity equation:
\beq
\tdif{U} + gH \xdif{\zeta} + RU + X = 0
\eeq
\beq
\tdif{V} + gH \ydif{\zeta} + RV + Y = 0
\eeq
\beq
\tdif{\zeta} + \xdif{U} + \ydif{V} = 0
\eeq
where $x,y,t$ are the space coordinates and time, $U,V$ the
transports in $x,y$ direction, $\zeta$ the water level,
$R$ the friction parameter, $X,Y$ extra terms that cna be treated
explicitly in the following discretization, $g$ the gravitational
acceleration and $H$ the total water depth.

The transports $U,V$ can be obtained from the velocities by
\beq
U = \int u dz \hspace{1cm} V = \int v dz
\eeq
where $u,v$ are the current velocities.

The terms contained in $X,Y$ are the non-linear advective terms, the
Coriolis terms, the wind stress and the lateral eddy friction.
They may be written as
\beq
X = U \xdif{u} + V \ydif{u} - f V - \frac{\tau^x}{\rhon}
	- \aush ( \xxdif{U} + \yydif{U} )
\eeq
\beq
Y = U \xdif{v} + V \ydif{v} + f U - \frac{\tau^y}{\rhon}
	- \aush ( \xxdif{V} + \yydif{V} )
\eeq
where $f$ is the Coriolis parameter, $\tau^x,\tau^y$ the
wind stress, $\rhon$ the reference density of water and
$\aush$ the horizontal eddy viscosity.


\section*{Discretization of the Momentum Equation}


We now chose weighting parameters for the discretization. These parameters
are $a_z$ for the transports in the continuity equation, $a_m$
for the pressure term in the momentum equations and $a_r$ for
the friction term. Associated to these parameters are the parameters
$\azt, \amt, \art$ that are defined as
\beq
\azt = 1 - a_z \quad \amt = 1 - a_m \quad \art = 1 - a_r.
\eeq
All above parameters can take the values from 0 to 1 where
0 means an explicit treatment and 1 a complete implicit treatment.

Discretizing the $x$ momentum equation one obtains
\beq
\frac{\Unew-\Uold}{\dt} + gH [ \am \xdif{\znew} + \amt \xdif{\zold} ]
	+ R [ \ar \Unew + \art \Uold ] + X = 0
\eeq
where the total depth $H$ and the extra terms $X$ are always taken
at the old time step.

Solving for $\Unew$ and introducing the new parameter 
\beq
\delta = \frac{1}{1 + \dt R \ar}
\eeq
we obtain 
\beq
\Unew = \delta (1 - \dt R \art) U 
		- \dt \delta gH [ \am \xdif{\znew} + \amt \xdif{\zold} ]
		- \dt \delta X.
\eeq

Introducing two more auxiliary parameters
\beq
	\gamma = \delta [ 1 - \dt R \art ] \quad
	\beta = \dt \delta gH
\eeq
we finally have for both momentum equations
\beq
\Unew = \gamma U 
		- \beta \am \xdif{\znew} - \beta \amt \xdif{\zold} 
		- \dt \delta X
\eeq
\beq
\Vnew = \gamma V 
		- \beta \am \ydif{\znew} - \beta \amt \ydif{\zold} 
		- \dt \delta Y
\eeq
where the equation in $y$ direction
has been obtained in a similar way obtained in a similar way
as the one in $x$ direction.


\section*{Spatial Integration of the Momentum Equation}


We integrate the momentum equations over one element. For this
we multiply every term with the constant weighting function
$\Psi$ and integrate. Remember that $U,V$ are constant over an
element, and $\zeta$ is varying linearly. The single terms
give
\beq
\int \Psi \Unew \dO = \AO \Unew
\eeq
\beq
\int \Psi X \dO = \int X \dO
\eeq
\beq
\int \xdif{\znew} \dO = \int b_M \znew_M \dO = \AO b_M \znew_M
\eeq
\beq
\int \ydif{\znew} \dO = \int c_M \znew_M \dO = \AO c_M \znew_M
\eeq
where $\Omega$ is the integration domain, $\AO$ the area of the
triangle and $b_M, c_M$ are the constant derivatives of the 
linear form functions $\Phi$
\beq
b_M = \xdif{\Phi} \quad c_M = \ydif{\Phi}.
\eeq

We therefore obtain
\beq
\Unew = \gamma U 
		- \beta \am b_M \znew_M - \beta \amt b_M \zold_M 
		- \dt \delta \Xb
\eeq
\beq
\Vnew = \gamma V 
		- \beta \am c_M \znew_M - \beta \amt c_M \zold_M 
		- \dt \delta \Yb
\eeq
with
\beq
\Xb = \frac{1}{\AO} \int X \dO \quad
\Yb = \frac{1}{\AO} \int Y \dO.
\eeq


\section*{Integration of the Continuity Equation}

We first integrate the continuity equation over one element
and obtain
\beq
\int \Phi \xdif{\znew} \dO = \int b_M \znew_M \dO = \AO b_M \znew_M
\eeq
