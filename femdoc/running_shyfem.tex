In the following an overview is given on running the model
\shy{}. The model needs a parameter input file that is read
on standard input. Moreover, it needs some external files that
are specified in this parameter input file. The model produces
several external files with the results of the simulation. Again,
the name of this files can be influenced by the parameter input file
