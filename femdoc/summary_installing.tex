In summary, the following steps have to be carried out before you will
be able to run the model:

\begin{itemize}

\item Get the distribution and unpack it in a place of your choice.

\item Move to the root of the distribution (\ttt{e.g., cd \shydir}).

\item Check if all software is available (|make check_software|). This
step has to be done only the first time you install SHYFEM on a computer.

\item Install the model (|make install|). This has to be done every time
you get and install a new version of the model.

\item Adjust options in |Rules.make|. This has to be done every time you
change options (compiler, parallel execution, etc.). After this you have
to run also |make cleanall|.

\item Adjust dimension parameters in |Rules.make|. This has to be done the
first time and every time you change application (basin, etc.) to adapt
the dimensions to the new problem. You might also run |make cleanall|
after this step, but it is not required.

\item Compile the programs with |make fem| and have a look at the error
messages.

\end{itemize}

Moreover, below a summary of administrative commands is given that are
available in SHYFEM. \vspace{0.5cm}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ l p{7cm} }
|make version|		&	shows version of distribution \\
|make clean|		&	deletes objects and executables from a previous
                        	compilation \\
|make cleanall|		&	same as |make clean| but also deletes 
				compiled libraries \\
|make fem|		&	compiles SHYFEM \\
|make doc|		&	makes this manual (|femdoc/shyfem.pdf|) \\
|make check_software|	&	checks the availability of installed software \\
|make check_compilation|&	checks if all programs have been compiled \\
|make changed|		&	finds files that are changed with respect to the
				original distribution \\
|make changed_zip|	&	zips files that are changed with respect to the
				original distribution to the file 
				|changed_zip.zip| \\
|make install|		&	installs SHYFEM \\
|make uninstall|	&	uninstalls SHYFEM \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\vspace{0.5cm}
Finally, if you have installed the model with |make install|, 
the following utility commands are available \vspace{0.5cm}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ l l }
|shyfemdir|		&	shows information about actual SHYFEM
				settings \\
|shyfemdir fem_dir|	&	sets |fem_dir| to be the new default 
				SHYFEM version \\
|shyfeminstall|		&	shows information about original SHYFEM 
				installation \\
|shyfemcd|		&	moves into root of actual SHYFEM directory \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
