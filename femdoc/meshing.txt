In order to use the "mesh" algorithm you will have to provide the program
a coastline in which the program will insert triangles. There are some
things to be remembered:

There must be exactly one closed outer (external) line that will enclose
all the other lines given in the coastline file. This means that it is
not possible to mesh two independent domains at the same time. Clearly,
you can divide the grid file into more files, each of which contains
just one independent domain. These files can then be meshed independently.

The program normally is able to find out what is the external line. It
will simply be the line that encloses all the other lines. If no such line
is found, then this will lead to an error. The program will distinguish
between the external line, islands and fault lines. Fault lines are lines
that will constrain triangles to not cross these lines. For example,
putting a fault line along the edge of a channel will ensure that the
triangles will not cross the channel edge but will be placed along
this edge.

In order to decide what line is of which type, the program considers the
largest closest line as the external line, all other lines as islands, and
any open line as a fault line. Normally this is the expected behavior. The
program will classify these lines only if the line type is 0.

If you want to overwrite this behavior you can give explicit line types to
the lines in the coast line file. A type of 1 signals an external line,
a type of 2 an island, and a type of 4 a fault line. Clearly there can
be only one line with type 1. If you have more than one line with type
1 the program will exit with an error. You can however have a fault line
which is closed, a behavior that will not be possible with the automatic
determination of line types, because a closed line with type 0 is always
an island. Clearly an open line with type 2 (island) is also an error.
