new new11.f

do we really compute baroclinically

difference if we use non linear terms
difference if we use austausch terms

double precision to see mass (salt) conservation

in barox/yv ate also contribs from non-linear and austausch terms

ireib is not used by 3d model, only czdef -> unify

in new11.f -> regularize use of smooth boundary condition

give baroc0 as parameter to compute baroc only in area=0 areas

big error for mass conservation in run adf301 after ~ 120000 sec.
	-> maybe because implicit in vertical
	-> set adpar = aapar = 0.

=======================================================================

ireib, czdef, area values ... (FIXME)

iweich -> integrate

run on lagoon with no barenas

check bcolin (iclin) and h1hv (are the compatible)

why are benchnew.str and lag3d01.str different
	-> overshoot of minimum for 3D version with just
		one layer

following data structure is doubled:

        common /ilinkv/ilinkv(nkndim+1), /lenkv/lenkv(2*nlidim)
        common /ngrv/ngrv(nkndim+1), /igrv/igrv(nkndim*ngrdim)

hard coded nkndim, neldim in sublnk.f subdwq.f subres.f subcon.f
	-> maybe with define ?

=======================================================================

3-D model

check mass balance 
	- u/v	-> w at OB
	- c     open boundary with c=0,  different types ibtyp=2,3

	-> use bio02.str in test3d


=======================================================================

modules that must be added to fem for compatibility with Technital:

open/close	-> hp, cst, n36, nls, nsh
delwaq
float
flux	-> old way

=======================================================================

Wind:

implement : stress computed in subwin
		Smith and Bancke (and others)

may be also R (friction coefficient) computed in own subroutine

=======================================================================

if nothing given checzy is 0 -> error

=======================================================================

rcv error:

	in bio3d call to scal3sh is with rcv 3D
	in scal3sh expects one-dimensional

	-> BUG !!! change

=======================================================================

check boundary routines:

	- iqual
	- sin

=======================================================================

evaporation -> sal
toxi
* levmax -> input from below -> lmin introduced in set_mass_flux
parallel code

confop -> include levels
delete: bnds_set_global volno0 infobnd

=======================================================================

general routine for flx/ext/etc to decide when to output
routine to limit processors for parallel computation
eliminate big matrix (matdim) when using sparskit

=======================================================================
