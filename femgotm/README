18.12.2008		bug fix for 2 layer system:

	in diff_face.F90 (look for GGU_BUG_FIX)

	test executed in ~/appl/christian/bug_518

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear All,

I think I found the problem. Hans was right: the problem appears if
you have only two layers (which can happen in coastal areas with
Z-levels. Actually, in the Venice lagoon there are a lot of these
nodes around.)

The error is in diff_face (and maybe also in other parts). Here is the code
that is wrong:


!   set up upper boundary condition
  select case(Bcup)
  case(Neumann)
     a     = dt*( nuY(N-1) + nuY(N-2) )  / ( h(N-1)+h(N) ) / h(N-1)
     l     = dt*Lsour(N-1)

and

!   set up lower boundary condition
  select case(Bcdw)
  case(Neumann)
     c     = dt*( nuY(2) + nuY(1) )  / ( h(1)+h(2) ) / h(2)
     l     = dt*Lsour(1)

In the case of only two layers, nuY(2) and nuY(N-2) (which is nuY(0)
are not defined nor computed. Anything that happens in the memory
locations from
other calculations is used.

I guess the best thing would be to set these two values to the one
immediately below/above. I will try this out and let you know.

Ciao, Georg

Dear All,

this should be my last message before Christmas. I have two things yet
to discuss.
The first is a quick and dirty solution to the problem. In diff_face,
right at the beginning of the executable code I inserted:

!BOC
!
!  in case of two layers set nuY

  if( N .eq. 2 ) then
     nuY(0) = nuY(1)
     nuY(N) = nuY(1)
  end if

!  set up matrix
  do i=2,N-2

In order for this to work, also the intent(in) when declaring nuY has
to be removed.
I know that this is not very elegant, but it works. Otherwise I would
have to change the code in more points (dissipationeq, genericeq,
kbeq, lengthscaleeq, q2over2eq, tkeeq). I guess Karsten will come up
with a more elegant solution.

Next point: I still see in some cases very high values of the
lenghtscale (and turbulent viscosities). After checking I found out
that in these cases the shear frequency was negative. I use the
formulation of Burchard (2002) that can be also found in shear.F90
(meanflow):


     SSU(i)= 0.5*(                                                     &
                 (cnpar*(u(i+1)-u(i))*(u(i+1)-uo(i))+                  &
                 (1.-cnpar)*(uo(i+1)-uo(i))*(uo(i+1)-u(i)))            &
                 /(0.5*(h(i+1)+h(i)))/h(i)                             &
                +(cnpar*(u(i+1)-u(i))*(uo(i+1)-u(i))+                  &
                 (1.-cnpar)*(uo(i+1)-uo(i))*(u(i+1)-uo(i)))            &
                 /(0.5*(h(i+1)+h(i)))/h(i+1)                           &
                 )

     SSV(i)= 0.5*( &
                 (cnpar*(v(i+1)-v(i))*(v(i+1)-vo(i))+                  &
                 (1.-cnpar)*(vo(i+1)-vo(i))*(vo(i+1)-v(i)))            &
                 /(0.5*(h(i+1)+h(i)))/h(i)                             &
                +(cnpar*(v(i+1)-v(i))*(vo(i+1)-v(i))+                  &
                 (1.-cnpar)*(vo(i+1)-vo(i))*(v(i+1)-vo(i)))            &
                 /(0.5*(h(i+1)+h(i)))/h(i+1)                           &
                 )

Clearly, if there is current reversal between two time steps, this can
become negative. And in effect, it does close to the bottom. This is
not limited to 2 layers. Actually, this happens in deeper water (9 m
for the lagoon is deep, for others this may be shallow).

What to do? Inserting some abs() statements does avoid the problem. Is
this the right way to do, Hans?

Merry Christmas, Georg

30.10.2008		another bug fix for 2 layer system:

	in diff_face.F90 (look for GGU_BUG_FIX_1)

dissipationeq.F90	eps
genericeq.F90		psi
kbeq.F90		kb
lengthscaleeq.F90	q2l
q2over2eq.F90		tke
tkeeq.F90		tke

eps, kb, tke are global
psi, q2l are local -> psi is set (0 and N0, but eps not
