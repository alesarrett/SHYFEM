8.2 - HSI, HSL, HSV, and related color spaces 

The representation of the colors in the RGB and CMY(K) color spaces are
designed for specific devices. But for a human observer, they are not
useful definitions. For user interfaces a more intuitive color space,
designed for the way we actually think about color is to be preferred.
Such a
color space is HSI; Hue, Saturation and Intensity, which can be thought
of as a RGB cube tipped up onto one corner. The line from RGB=min to
RGB=max becomes verticle and is the intensity axis. The position of a
point on the circumference of a circle around this axis is the hue and
the
saturation is the radius from the central intensity axis to the color. 

                 Green
                  /\
                /    \    ^
              /V=1 x   \   \ Hue (angle, so that Hue(Red)=0, 
       Blue -------------- Red       Hue(Green)=120, and Hue(blue)=240
deg)
            \      |     /
             \     |-> Saturation (distance from the central axis)
              \    |   /
               \   |  /
                \  | /
                 \ |/
               V=0 x (Intensity=0 at the top of the apex and =1 at the
base of the cone)

The big disadvantage of this model is the conversion which is mainly
because the hue is expressed as an angle. The transforms are given
below: 

    Hue = (Alpha-arctan((Red-intensity)*(3^0.5)/(Green-Blue)))/(2*PI)
    with { Alpha=PI/2 if Green>Blue
         { Aplha=3*PI/2 if Green<Blue
         { Hue=1 if Green=Blue
    Saturation =
(Red^2+Green^2+Blue^2-Red*Green-Red*Blue-Blue*Green)^0.5
    Intensity = (Red+Green+Blue)/3

Note that you have to compute Intensity *before* Hue. If not, you must
assume that: 

    Hue =
(Alpha-arctan((2*Red-Green-Blue)/((Green-Blue)*(3^0.5))))/(2*PI).

I assume that H, S, L, R, G, and B are within the range of [0;1].
Another point of view of this cone is to project the coordinates onto
the base.
The 2D projection is: 

    Red:   (1;0)
    Green: (cos(120 deg);sin(120 deg)) = (-0.5; 0.866)
    Blue:  (cos(240 deg);sin(240 deg)) = (-0.5;-0.866)
    Now you need intermediate coordinates:
    x = Red-0.5*(Green+Blue)
    y = 0.866*(Green-Blue)

Finally, you have: 

    Hue = arctan2(x,y)/(2*PI) ; Just one formula, always in the correct
quadrant
    Saturation = (x^2+y^2)^0.5
    Intensity = (Red+Green+Blue)/3

Another model close to HSI is HSL. It's actually a double cone with
black and white points placed at the two apexes of the double cone. I
don't
provide formula, but feel free to send me the formula you could find.
;-) 

    we got this from Fabrice Lestideau :
    Hi,
    I give you the formula of the HLS color space:
    L= (max+min)/2
    if L<=0.5     S=(max-min)/(max+min)
    else               S=(max-min)/(2-max-min)

    if (max=R)        H=(G-B)/(max-min)
    if (max+G)        H=(2+(B-R)/(max-min))
    if (max+B)        H=(4+(R-G)/(max-min))

    thank you for your color faq.

    you're welcome.

Actually, here are many variations on HSI, e.g. HSL, HSV, HCI (chroma /
colorfulness), HVC, TSD (hue saturation and darkness) etc. But they
all do basically the same thing.
