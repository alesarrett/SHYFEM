======================================================= 13.09.93

CompressNumbers() to compress node and element numbers

Defined in gridfi.c and called in WriteFiles (gridfi)

new functions DeleteNode(pn) and DeleteElem(pe) that delete a 
	node and element structure

redefined functions DeleteByElemNumber(H,elem) and
	DeleteByNodeNumber(H,node) -> they only take out the node
	or elem structure from the hash table and give back
	this structure. They do not delete the information in
	the structure.

======================================================= ??.10.93

PlotPoint(Node_type *p) instead of PlotPoint(x,y,ntype) !!!
	--> still some old programs that have to be adjusted
		like inside,interpol (ok,14.10.93)

======================================================= 11.10.93

OpShowType introduced ( 0 -> show depth, 1 -> show element type )

	1 is chosen with -T on command line

	- PlotElem plots according to OpShowType
	- WriteToMesWin ...
	- Colortable 0 set up according to OpShowType

in Elem_type introduced   short int type;

ReadDepth3, WriteDepth3 : handle type 2 in depth file

CHANGE_TYPE, ActType, String..., ... introduced -> CHANGE_TYPE and
	CHANGE_DEPTH are mutually exclusive 

also KeyboardInput has been changed for CHANGE_TYPE

======================================================= 12.10.93

ReadBas reads also area code in element structure, may use with -T option

ColTab for OpShowType=1 LightGray removed, is equal to PlotCol

======================================================= 14.10.93

WriteNodes7 for wind (type 7) data - extension .wsc
	grid, gridfi & griddi changed
	ReadNodes7 moved from griddi to gridfi
	ReadNodes7 does not anymore scale x/y coordinates
	PlotPoint: arrow is drawn with new factor

======================================================= 19.10.93

wind files for 2 directions implemented :
	new Wind_type structure that holds wind data
		...(not anymore in depth,inumber)
		...(direction not anymore integer)
	in Node_type structure new entry void *extra, an entry
		that holds a pointer to a special structure
	MakeWind makes new Wind_type structure
	new GetWind that gets Wind_type structure
	all changes to arrow are made in ChangeWindDir

======================================================= 20.10.93

wind files for 2 directions :
	DeleteWind -> deletes wind structure
	DeleteNode -> calles DeleteWind
	AdjustDWind -> argument is now Node_type * and not List_type *
	AdjustDWind -> arrow with smallest angle is chosen
	extra -> access is limited to few functions
	WriteToMesWindow -> write speed in case of OpWind > 0
		...(in this version does not write type)
	PlotPoint -> factor in PfeilUV set to 400 (old 200)
	DeleteByNodeNumber, DeleteByElemNumber -> no return value
		are called now by DeleteNode, DeleteElem
	Wind_type -> structure changed : total,flag,speed[4],dir[4]
	GetWindData(), GetOtherWindData() to access wind data
	DeleteWind() to delete one arrow
	DeleteWindType() to free structure
	- data is not exchanged anymore but a flag is set to show
		...what data is valid

======================================================= 21.10.93

wind files for 2 directions :
	ERROR !!! in AdjustDWind : Node_type *pn was passed
		but also declared as local -> local declaration
		had precedence and no valid pointer was
		available

======================================================= 27.10.93

new files gridps.c, gridps.h for print to postscript
	file
also new psgraph.c, psgraph.h from pgraph.c/h that
	handle the interface to the Postscript
	driver (had to change names since Q names
	already in use with xgraph)
actually ps print is done by clicking on Cancel
	(there is no command button free)
introduced in grid Changed and PsPlot
	Changed : asks only for output filename
	  if something has changed
	PsPlot : may plot more than one snapshot
	  and close file only at end -> gridfi.c

======================================================= 30.10.94
