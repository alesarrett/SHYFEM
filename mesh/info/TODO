- if elements are given in input file -> segmentation fault
	-> what to do with elements?

- if no boundary line given -> insert hull as boundary line

- try to insert point not at CM, but in an other place

- in MakeNode/Elem/Line -> routine to make extra structure

- better placement of boundary nodes with refinement
	- relax spacing between nodes
	- position on spline

- use heap structure to find next element

- final check on grid quality -> edge swapping

- after insertion of boundary nodes NEL is not used anymore
	-> what to do with it

*- refining internal points -> 
	sometimes external element must be deleted
	-> this is not done
	-> no point is inserted, so the element remains very big
	-> to solve: maybe try to insert point not at CM, but in
		an other place

*- inserting boundary nodes:
	make sure original boundary line is retained
	-> maybe insert points at boundary where this is not given
	(the error is already in orgbound.grd)

*- controll if lines are in anti-clockwise order and correct

*- ensure boundary integrity

*- background mesh (maybe with depths)

*- smoothing of inserted internal points

*- eliminate also internal boundaries

*- error with refining interior nodes : mesh -s50 -o0.25 -r3.2 elips
	-> after smoothing must retriangulate completly
	-> circumcircles are wrong for all triangles

*- adjourn help screen

- profiling

- look for memory sinks

*- better input file for mesh
	-> maybe use grd file structure

*- no file -> segmentation fault
